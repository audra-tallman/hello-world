My Programming Adventure Repository

Hello!

My name is Audra and I'm excited to beginning this new adventure in programming! I'm a former special educator seeking a change and pursuing a new career in web development and software programming. I'll be starting a program at Flat Iron School next month and can't wait to see what the future has in store.
